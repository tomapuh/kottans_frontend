I've just finished online course about GIT!  I am happy to learn such interesting course, thanks Sarah and Carolyne.
- All information was new for me, i am only beginner.
- I was surprised that many people can work on the project together and return to previous versions at any time without loss of data.
- I think all new knowledge will be useful. I'm going to practice immediately.
